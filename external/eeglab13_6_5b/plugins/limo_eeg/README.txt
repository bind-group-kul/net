The LInear MOdelling of EEG data (LIMO EEG) toolbox is a Matlab toolbox dedicated to the analysis of MEEG data. It is interfaced with EEGLAB to act as a plug in. However, once data are imported all is performed within LIMO EEG and the toolbox can thus work for any data sets.

The repository is the developmental version - the stable version can be downlaoaded from https://gforge.dcn.ed.ac.uk/gf/project/limo_eeg/
